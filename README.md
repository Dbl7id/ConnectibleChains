## Description
Connect your fences/walls with a decorative chain!

Use the normal vanilla chain item on fences or walls, and you can create a chain for up to 7 blocks long.

These chains have collision but can be broken when attacking it with a shear. \
Sneak on fences if you do not want to place them normally.

I am not in the mood to figure out how to allow chains from other mods to be added.
