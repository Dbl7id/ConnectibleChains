## Description
Connect your fences/walls with a decorative chain!

Use the normal vanilla chain item on fences or walls, and you can create a chain for up to 7 blocks long.

These chains have collision but can be broken when attacking it with a shear. \
Sneak on fences if you do want to place them normally.

#### Issues

If you have encountered any bugs or have some feedback, go to the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/legoatoom/ConnectibleChains/issues) page.

#### Forge?
There is a Forge Port that is currently doesn't have collisions. Made by lilypuree \
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/connectible-chains-forge


#### Other information

If there are invisible collisions for some reason, hold a shear while
having entity hitboxes on (F3+B) to see the collisions and then attack them to remove them.

Currently, I do not want to add this functionality to chains from other mods.

For resourcepacks, the chain around the fence can be altered.\
The chain connection can sadly not be changed similarly to lead connections.
