## Description
Connect your fences with a decorative chain!

Use the normal vanilla chain item on fences, and you can create a chain for up to 7 blocks long. 

These chains won't stop anything, but they look great!
Sneak on fences if you do not want to place them normally.

### The reason why it is alpha

This mod requires a lot of sync between server/client. I am very new to this so I do not feel comfortable releasing this as fully working. I have been using it for without any bugs. So it should work, but please tell me if you find anything.
